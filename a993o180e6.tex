 This work may also begin to better illuminate the connection between
 pulsations and large mass loss rates highlighted in the original work
 of Yoon and Cantiello (2010). They showed that the amplitudes of
 pulsations may become large enough to drive a time-dependent
 'super-wind' adequate to yield a substantial loss of the outer
 envelope of the RSG, substantially impacting how the resulting core
 collapse supernovae would appear to the observer.
