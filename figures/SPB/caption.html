<div data-label="226017">Left: MESA/GYRE SPB Instability strip for dipole modes.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\eta\)</span> [0,1] indicates the strength of the opacity driven instability. Top Right:&nbsp;Propagation diagram for an SPB model with M = 5Msun and Teff= 16000K. The horizontal black line indicates the frequencyof a typical SPB g-mode excited by the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\kappa\)</span> mechanism. Bottom Right: the black solid line shows the critical magnetic field strength needed to strongly alter dipolar g-modes of frequency ng. The green dashed line shows the predicted magnetic field in the radiative region outside the convective core calculated assuming equipartition fields generated via an MS dynamo.&nbsp;</div>
