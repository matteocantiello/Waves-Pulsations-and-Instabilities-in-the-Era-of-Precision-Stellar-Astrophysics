<div data-label="226017"><b>Left</b>: MESA/GYRE SPB Instability strip for dipole modes. The growth rate&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\eta\)</span> indicates the strength of the opacity driven instability. <b>Top Right</b>:&nbsp;Propagation diagram for an SPB model with M = 5Msun and Teff= 16000K. The horizontal black line indicates the frequency&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\nu_g\)</span>of a typical SPB g-mode excited by the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\kappa\)</span> mechanism. <b>Bottom Right</b>: the black solid line shows the critical magnetic field strength needed to strongly alter dipolar g-modes of frequency&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\nu_g\)</span>. The green dashed line shows the predicted magnetic field in the radiative region outside the convective core calculated assuming equipartition fields generated via an MS dynamo.&nbsp;</div>
