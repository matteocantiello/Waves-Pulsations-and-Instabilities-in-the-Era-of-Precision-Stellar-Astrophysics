<div data-label="685379">A 2D vertical slice of temperature fluctuations (left) and chemical concentration (right) in a 3D simulation of convective boundary mixing (Lecoanet et al 2016). The bottom of the convection zone is shown by the dashed line. The averaged chemical concentration satisfies a diffusion equation which can be implemented in 1D stellar evolution codes&nbsp;</div>
