<div data-label="334438">Rotation angular velocity plotted as a function of fractional radius $x=r/R$, for a $4.21\,M_{\odot}$ model starting from a non-rotating state and subject to 1,000 years of angular momentum transport by a dipole ($\ell=1$) g mode (blue curve). The red curve shows the profile of a  stellar model tuned to match the surface velocity of the blue curve.</div>
