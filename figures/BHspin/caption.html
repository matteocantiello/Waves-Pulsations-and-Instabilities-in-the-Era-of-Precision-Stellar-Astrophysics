Typical rotation rates&nbsp; of 30-200 ms are similar to inferred distributions of young pulsars \citep{gullon:14}.&nbsp; {\bf Bottom:} Aligned component of black hole spins, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, as a function of chirp mass for existing LIGO detections of BH mergers. All events except for GW151226 (chirp mass of about 9&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(M_\odot\)</span> )are consistent with very low black hole spins.  &nbsp;</div>
