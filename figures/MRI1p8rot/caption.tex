 \label{fig:MRI1.8rot} Spin rate of a $1.8 \, M_\odot$ model with MS rotation period of $P_{\rm MS} = 2 \, {\rm d}$, a typical progenitor of red giants and white dwarfs with asteroseismic rotation  The blue line shows the surface rotation, while the black line shows the core rotation period including AM transport by the TS dynamo. The red line shows the core rotation rate including
