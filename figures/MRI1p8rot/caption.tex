 \label{fig:MRI1p8rot} Spin rate of a $1.8 \, M_\odot$ model with MS rotation period of $P_{\rm MS} = 2 \, {\rm d}$, a typical progenitor of red giants and white dwarfs with asteroseismic rotation measurements. The blue line shows the surface rotation, while the black line shows the core rotation period including AM transport by the TS dynamo. The red line shows the core rotation rate including a preliminary presciption for AM transport by baroclinic instabilities, which nicely matches observations.
