\section{Relevance to NASA and TCAN}



Our research is highly relevant to NASA's Physics of the Cosmos and Cosmic Origins Programs. Our work will examine the behavior of matter in the extreme conditions present deep inside stars. Importantly, we will make observational predictions for surface properties of stars that can be used to test the physics operating in the stellar core. Additionally, our proposed research is closely related to several NASA space missions. Most directly, our theoretical work will help maximize the scientific yield from the TESS mission, allowing for interpretation of TESS data on t

Similarly, SNe falling within {\it K2} and {\it TESS} fields will have exquisite optical/near-infrared lightcurves that can capture shock breakout signatures and the very early light curve, both of which are shaped by the density profile near the stellar surface at the time of explosion. Our work will determine whether existing and future SN data from {\it K2} and {\it TESS} can be explained as a result of wave-driven mass loss from the progenitor. Finally, exquisite IR data on SNe and their progenitors will be obtained in the near future by {\it JWST}, and further in the future with {\it WFIRST}. Similar to {\it HST}, {\it JWST} may provide exquisite data on SN progenitors through a {\it JWST} LEGUS survey. These data will provide new constraints on progenitor luminosity and variability in the IR, especially for cool RSGs and stars enshrouded in dust due to high pre-SN mass loss rates. Comparison with our work can determine whether wave-driven mass loss occurs in cool/obscured SN progenitors.
