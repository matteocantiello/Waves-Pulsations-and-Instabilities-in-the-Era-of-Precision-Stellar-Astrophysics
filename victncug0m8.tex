\subsubsection{Angular Momentum Transport by Heat-driven Pulsation Modes}

Transport of angular momentum by internal gravity waves (IGWs) has been extensively in the context of lower-mass stars \citep[e.g.,][]{Schatzman:1993,Kumar:1997,Zahn:1997,Talon:2002,Talon:2005,Rogers:2008}, where the waves are excited by turbulent motions within an envelope convection zone. Recent studies explore whether the same waves might be important in shaping the internal rotation of more-massive stars during their main-sequence evolution. The principal focus has been on IGWs excited stochastically at the convective core boundary \citep[e.g.][]{Rogers:2013,Lee:2014,Rogers:2015}. However, there is another potent source of gravity waves which may prove to be even more effective at transporting angular momentum: during their main-sequence evolution, all stars with masses $M \gtrsim 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ pass through one or more phases where pulsation modes (standing acoustic and internal gravity waves) are excited by a heat-engine mechanism which converts thermal energy into mechanical work. The mechanism is similar to the opacity-valve process described by \citet{Eddington:1926} for classical Cepheid pulsators, but keyed to iron and nickel opacity rather than hydrogen and helium opacity. It leads to distinct classes of variable star in the upper part of the main sequence: the slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars, ($2.5\,M_{\odot} \lesssim M \lesssim 9\,M_{\odot}$) where g modes (standing IGWs) with periods of days; the $\beta$ Cephei pulsators ($M \gtrsim 9\,M_{\odot$) 

\citet{Rogers:2013aa} and
\citet{Rogers:2015aa} use two-dimensional anelastic hydrodynamical
simulations to investigate the impact of internal gravity waves
(IGWs), excited at the convective core boundary, on the internal
rotation profile of massive stars. \citet{Lee:2014aa} consider whether
the same IGWs can supply the necessary angular momentum to form the
episodic decretion disk seen in the rapidly rotating Be star HD~51452.


Athough much of the recent focus 

Background:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Every star with $M \gtrsim 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ passes through one or more heat-driven instability strip during its main sequence evolution
 \item In these instability strips, p modes and g modes excited by a kappa mechanism caused by iron opacity
 \item g modes thus excited can transport angular momentum from driving regions and deposit it in damping regions (p modes less important)
 \item \citet{Townsend:2017aa} demonstrated how a single g mode can drive the surface layers of slowly-pulsating B stars to $\approx 100\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ on timescales of $10^{3}$ years
 \item Thus, heat-driven modes are not just a useful tool for probing the internal structure of massive stars; they can also be a main player in \emph{modifying} this structure.
 \end{itemize}
 
 Proposed efforts:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Extend angular momentum transport simulations to $M \gtrsim 10\,M_{\odot}$ parts of main sequence, where g modes are excited toward TAMS
 \item Also extend transport sims to post-TAMS models (see Convective Boundaries section)
 \item Improve GYRE to model effects of differential rotation on wave transport.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item First step will just use traditional approximation
 \item Main effort (and main code development) will involve using a spectral (spherical harmonic) expansion to solve the 2D (r-theta) pulsation problem without need for traditional approximation
 \end{itemize}
 \item Apply transport sims to specific \emph{Kepler}/\emph{K2} stars with measured multi-mode spectra (i.e., mode parameters, amplitudes), to predict AM fluxes and assess whether they are consistent/contradict current estimates of internal rotation profile.
 \end{itemize}
