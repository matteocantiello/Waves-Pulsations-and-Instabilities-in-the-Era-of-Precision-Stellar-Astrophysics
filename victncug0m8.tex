\subsubsection{Angular Momentum Transport by Heat-driven Pulsation Modes}

Transport of angular momentum by internal gravity waves (IGWs) has been a topic of great recent interest. 
Athough much of the recent focus 

Background:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Every star with $M \gtrsim 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ passes through one or more heat-driven instability strip during its main sequence evolution
 \item In these instability strips, p modes and g modes excited by a kappa mechanism caused by iron opacity
 \item g modes thus excited can transport angular momentum from driving regions and deposit it in damping regions (p modes less important)
 \item \citet{Townsend:2017aa} demonstrated how a single g mode can drive the surface layers of slowly-pulsating B stars to $\approx 100\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ on timescales of $10^{3}$ years
 \item Thus, heat-driven modes are not just a useful tool for probing the internal structure of massive stars; they can also be a main player in \emph{modifying} this structure.
 \end{itemize}
 
 Proposed efforts:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Extend angular momentum transport simulations to $M \gtrsim 10\,M_{\odot}$ parts of main sequence, where g modes are excited toward TAMS
 \item Also extend transport sims to post-TAMS models (see Convective Boundaries section)
 \item Improve GYRE to model effects of differential rotation on wave transport.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item First step will just use traditional approximation
 \item Main effort (and main code development) will involve using a spectral (spherical harmonic) expansion to solve the 2D (r-theta) pulsation problem without need for traditional approximation
 \end{itemize}
 \item Apply transport sims to specific \emph{Kepler}/\emph{K2} stars with measured multi-mode spectra (i.e., mode parameters, amplitudes), to predict AM fluxes and assess whether they are consistent/contradict current estimates of internal rotation profile.
 \end{itemize}
