\subsubsection{Angular Momentum Transport by Heat-driven Pulsation Modes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Every star with $M \gtrsim 2.5\,\Msun$ passes through one or more heat-driven instability strip during its main sequence evolution
\item In these instability strips, p modes and g modes excited by a kappa mechanism caused by iron opacity

\end{itemize}
