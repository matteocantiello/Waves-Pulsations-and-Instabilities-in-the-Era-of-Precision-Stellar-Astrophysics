\subsection{Convective Wave Excitation}
}
\label{convex}

Convectively excited waves can transport angular momentum and chemical species in stars, leading to interesting diagnostic and evolutionary effects. However, the strength of these effects are proportional to the flux of the waves excited by convection. Many theories have been proposed for the form of this wave flux \citep{Press_1981,Goldreich_1990,Belkacem_2008,Lecoanet_2013}, but numerical simulations have yet to support any theory \citep{Rogers_2006,Rogers_2013,Alvan_2014,Lecoanet_2015}. We intend to determine the wave flux spectrum, which is expected to take the form of a power law,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d F_{\rm w}}{d\log \omega \log k_h} = M_{\rm c}F_{\rm c} \left(k_h H_{\rm c}\right)^{a} \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{\rm c}}\right)^{-b} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $F_{\rm w}$ is the wave energy flux, $\omega$ is the wave frequency and $k_h$ is the horizontal wavenumber. There is broad agreement that the total wave flux is roughly equal to the convective Mach number $M_{\rm c}$ times the convective flux $F_{\rm c}$ \citep[e.g.,][]{Rogers_2013,Lecoanet_2015}. However, analytic theories predict a very strong dependence on the frequency, e.g., $b\sim 7$, but simulations typically find more shallow spectra with $b\sim 3$ \citep{Rogers_2013}. The dependence on the frequency is especially important as low frequency waves (which carry most of the wave flux) are often strongly damped and do not influence stellar evolution. 

We will run a series of three-dimensional simulations specifically designed to test theories of wave generation. The theories assume a separation of scales between the frequency of large-scale convective eddies ($\omega_{\rm c}$) and the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the radiative zone ($N$). This also requires high spatial resolution because the turbulent cascade must be resolved between these two timescales. Preliminary tests suggest we can use Dedalus to run simulations with $N/\omega_{\rm c}\sim 30$, which should be enough to accurately measure the wave spectrum. We will vary the ratio $N/\omega_{\rm c}$ and the resolution in our simulations to make sure that we have achieved the appropriate scale separation. The wave flux spectrum parameters will be used to implement angular momentum and chemical transport algorithms in MESA, following the work of \citet{fullerwave:14,fullerwave:15}.  %We will also study the effects of rotation on wave generation. This is important because rotation will change both the properties of the waves and the convection.

\subsection{Directly Observing Convectively Excited Internal Gravity Waves}}

There is currently no unambiguous detection of IGW stochastically excited by convection in any type of star. Observed IGW are excited by other means, e.g., heat driven instabilities in SPB stars. Nonetheless, internal gravity waves excited by convection are believed to be a key source of angular momentum and energy transport and chemical mixing in stellar interiors.  Such waves have been invoked to explain a wide range of stellar observations, including the rotation of the solar interior \citep{Kumar_1999}, the rotation of pulsars \citep{fullerwave:15}, enhanced chemical mixing inferred from asteroseismology \citep{moravveji:15}, and large pre-supernova mass loss inferred from circumstellar interaction in core-collapse supernovae \citep{quataert:12}.   Directly calibrating theoretical models of IGW excitation would thus impact a particularly wide range of stellar science.

Calculations of the observational manifestation of convectively excited IGW in main sequence stars suggest that they are most readily detectable in massive stars where core convection launches waves towards the surface, producing potentially detectable photospheric luminosity and radial velocity variations \citep{samadi2010,shiode2013}. These calculations are uncertain, however, because of the uncertain spectrum of IGW excited by convection (see Section \ref{convex}).  There are some indications in the photometry of massive stars with COROT for excess variability consistent with that expected from internal gravity waves \citep{Aerts2015}.  In addition, there is ubiquitous evidence for `macroturbulence' in the spectra of massive stars -- this requires large incoherent/turbulent velocities in the line forming region and could be produced by a superposition of IGW.

TESS will dramatically expand the range of massive stars with high precision photometry, making it much more likely that there will be photometric detections of IGW.  Our proposed network is ideally positioned to interpret these new observational results and assess their implications.  Moreover, we will utilize the numerical simulations of wave excitation described in section \ref{convex} to reassess with state-of-the art models the observational manifestation of convectively excited waves in both main sequence and evolved stars.  This will enable us to study a wide range of important science questions. What are the luminosity and velocity perturbations induced by waves at the stellar surface and how do the predictions compare to observations?   Can waves explain macroturbulence in massive star spectra? Which convection zone is more important for detectable waves at the surface, core convection or surface convection zones associated with partialionization temperature of iron and helium \citep{Cantiello2009}? Which phases of stellar evolution and which mass stars are the most propitious for observing stochastically excited internal gravity waves?  These calculations will use Dedalus to determine the spectrum of excited waves, MESA to calculate the stellar models, and Gyre to determine the wave damping rates and surface luminosity and velocity perturbations.  These calculations thus require the interaction of all of the nodes of our proposed network.
