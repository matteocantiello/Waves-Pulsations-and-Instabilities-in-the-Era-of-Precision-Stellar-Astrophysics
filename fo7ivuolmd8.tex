\subsection{Convective Wave Excitation}
}

We do not have a satisfactory theory for the excitation of wave by convection. This is a key uncertainty in estimating the angular momentum and chemical mixing due to these waves. We want to determine the wave flux spectrum, which is assumed to take the form of a power law,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d F_{\rm wave}}{d\log \omega \log k_
\end{equation}
Many theories have been proposed (cite), but we lack numerical, experimental, or observational evidence to support
