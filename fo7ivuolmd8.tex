\subsection{Convective Wave Excitation}
}

We do not have a satisfactory theory for the excitation of wave by convection. This is a key uncertainty in estimating the angular momentum and chemical mixing due to these waves. We want to determine the wave flux spectrum, which is assumed to take the form of a power law,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d F_{\rm w}}{d\log \omega \log k_h} = M_{\rm c}F_{\rm c} \left(k_h H_{\rm c}\right)^{a} \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{\rm c}}\right)^{b}.
\end{equation}
Simulations and experiments agree that the total 
Many theories have been proposed (cite), but we lack numerical, experimental, or observational evidence to support
