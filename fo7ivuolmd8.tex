\subsection{Convective Wave Excitation}
}

We do not have a satisfactory theory for the excitation of wave by convection. This is a key uncertainty in estimating the angular momentum and chemical mixing due to these waves. We want to determine the wave flux spectrum,. Many theories have been proposed (cite), but we lack numerical, experimental, or observational evidence to support
