\subsubsection{Chemical Mixing by Convectively Excited Waves}
}

Asteroseismology can be used to determine the chemical gradient profile in stars (**cite Conny**). These measurements show the evidence of convective boundary mixing, as well as a smaller amount of chemical mixing in t radiative zone of the star. One possible source of chemical
