\subsubsection{Chemical Mixing by Convectively Excited Waves}
}

Asteroseismology can be used to determine the chemical gradient profile in stars (**cite Conny**). These measurements show the evidence of convective boundary mixing, as well as a smaller amount of chemical mixing within the radiative zone of the star. One possible source of this chemical mixing is transport by waves. **Tami** analyzed tracer particles in a 2D simulation of waves excited by convection, and found that the
