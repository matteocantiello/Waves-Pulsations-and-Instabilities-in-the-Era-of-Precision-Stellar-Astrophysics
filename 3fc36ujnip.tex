When applied to more than 3000 red giants observed by the Kepler satellite, this technique revealed that strong magnetic fields are present in the cores of roughly 50\% of RGB stars with $M \! > \! 1.5 \, M_\odot$, but are very rare in stars with M $< 1.1M_\odot$ \citep{Stello_2016,Stello_2016a}. This is interpreted as the effect of MS core-dynamo-generated magnetic fields in the convective cores of $M \! > \! 1.1 \, M_\odot$ stars, suggesting that a large fraction of main sequence OBA stars could host strong internal magnetic fields.
