When applied to more than 3000 red giants observed by the Kepler satellite, this technique revealed that
strong magnetic fields (B $\gt 10^5$ G) are present in the core of roughly 50\% of RGB stars with M $\gt 1.5\msun$ (Stello et al. 2016).
Conversely, strong internal magnetic fields are very rare in stars with M $\ 1.1$\msun$. This is interpreted as the
effect of MS core-dynamo-generated magnetic fields in the convective cores of M > 1.1$\msun$ stars.
This result shows that a potentially very large fraction of main sequence OBA stars could host strong internal magnetic fields.
