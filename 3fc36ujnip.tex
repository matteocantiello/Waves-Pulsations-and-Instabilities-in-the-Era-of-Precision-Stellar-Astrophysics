When applied to more than 3000 red giants observed by the Kepler satellite, this technique revealed that
strong magnetic fields (B $> 10^5$ G) are present in the core of roughly 50\% of RGB stars with M $> 1.5M_\odot$ \citep{Stello_2016}.
Conversely, strong internal magnetic fields are very rare in stars with M $> 1.1M_\odot$ (\color). This is interpreted as the
effect of MS core-dynamo-generated magnetic fields in the convective cores of M $> 1.1M_\odot$ stars.
This result shows that a potentially very large fraction of main sequence OBA stars could host strong internal magnetic fields.
