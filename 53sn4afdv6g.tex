This technique was developed for red giants stars first, and utilizes the observations of mixed modes. Mixed modes are
oscillations that behave as pressure waves (p-modes) near the stellar surface and gravity waves (g-modes) in the stellar core.
The study of these oscillations allows to determine properties of both core and stellar envelope (e.g. Beck et al. 2012).
The presence of a strong magnetic field in the core is able to alter the propagation of the gravity waves (in particular the dipolar $\ell =1$ modes),
trapping mode energy in the core and effectively decreasing its visibility (Magnetic greenhouse effect, Fuller et al. 2016).
For some simple field configurations, this theoretical result is supported  by numerical simulations of the interaction between
internal gravity waves and magnetic fields using the Dedalus code (Lecoanet et al. 2017).
Red giants with strong internal magnetic fields (B > 10^5 G) can thus be identified by the presence of suppressed oscillation modes in their oscillation spectra.
