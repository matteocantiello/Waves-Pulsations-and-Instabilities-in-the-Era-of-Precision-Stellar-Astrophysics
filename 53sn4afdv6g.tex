Thanks to a new asteroseismic technique developed by our team, we are now in the position to detect strong {\it internal} magnetic fields. This technique was originally developed for red giants stars by utilizing observations of mixed modescillations that behave as pressure waves (p-modes) near the stellar surface and gravity waves (g-modes) in the stellar core. The study of these oscillations allows to determine properties of both core and stellar envelope \citep[e.g][]{Beck_2011}. The presence of a strong magnetic field in the core is able to alter the propagation of the gravity waves (in particular the dipolar $\ell =1$ modes),
leading to mode energy loss in the core which decreases its visibility at the surface \citep{Fuller_2015}. For some simple field configurations, this theoretical result is supported  by numerical simulations of the interaction between internal gravity waves and magnetic fields using the Dedalus code \citep{Lecoanet_2016}. Red giants with strong internal magnetic fields (B $> 10^5$ G) can thus be identified by the presence of depressed oscillation modes in their oscillation spectra \citep{Fuller_2015,Stello_2016}. Recent theoretical work from \citet{2017MNRAS.467.3212L} also confirms that  strong magnetic fields can provide an efficient mean of damping stellar oscillations, although it is still possible that some other unknown physical processes is at work in a subset of red giants with depressed dipole modes \citet{Mosser_2017}.
