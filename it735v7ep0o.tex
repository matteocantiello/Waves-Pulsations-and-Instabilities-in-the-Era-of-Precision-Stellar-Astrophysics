\citet{1997AampA...327..224H} explored the onset of the these pulsations using alinear non-adiabatic code, and explained the instability  as arising from the traditional $\kappa$-mechanism acting in the hydrogen ionization zone. They also pursued initial
non-linear calculations of the instability using a 1D hydrodynamic code, noting a prime challenge was the complicated interplay of convection and pulsation, as the whole outer envelope is fully convective, with a turnover time similar to or shorter than typical pulsation periods. To address this difficulty, we will extend the GYRE code to include convection-pulsation coupling using the mixing-length perturbative theory described by \citet{Grigahcene:2005}. This will involve modifying the linearized hydrodynamic equations to include momentum terms arising from the divergence of the turbulent pressure tensor, and energy terms arising from the divergence of the convective flux and from kinetic energy dissipation.
