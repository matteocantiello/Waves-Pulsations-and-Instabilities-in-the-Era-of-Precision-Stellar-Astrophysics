\citet{1997AampA...327..224H} explored the onset of the these pulsations using
their linear non-adiabatic code, and explained the instability 
as arising from the traditional Kappa mechanism acting in the
hydrogen ionization zone. They also pursued initial challenging
non-linear calculations of the growth of the instability using a 1D 
hydrodynamic code. They noted that one of the prime challenges to
their ability to diagnose the outcome was the complicated interplay of
convection and pulsation, as the whole outer envelope is fully
convective. We will (RICH!) ....
