 To address this difficulty, we will extend the GYRE code to include convection-pulsation coupling using the mixing-length perturbative theory described by \citet{Grigahcene:2005}. This will involve modifying the linearized hydrodynamic equations to include momentum terms arising from the divergence of the turbulent pressure tensor, and energy terms arising from the divergence of the convective flux and from kinetic energy dissipation.
