\subsubsection{Convective Boundary Mixing}
}

%Convective boundary mixing (CBM) is a major uncertainty in stellar evolution. The effects of CBM can be measured in eclipsing binary systems (e.g., Stancliffe et al, 2015), and via asteroseismology (e.g., Aerts et al, 2003).

Convective boundary mixing (CBM) is a major uncertainty in stellar evolution. It is essential important when nuclear burning occurs in a convection zone, as CBM can mix fresh fuel into the burning region, changing the time spent in different burning stages. The effects of CBM can be measured in massive main sequence sta
