\subsubsection{Convective Boundary Mixing}
}

%Convective boundary mixing (CBM) is a major uncertainty in stellar evolution. The effects of CBM can be measured in eclipsing binary systems (e.g., Stancliffe et al, 2015), and via asteroseismology (e.g., Aerts et al, 2003).

Convective boundary mixing (CBM)  can change the time spent in different stages of stellar evolution
