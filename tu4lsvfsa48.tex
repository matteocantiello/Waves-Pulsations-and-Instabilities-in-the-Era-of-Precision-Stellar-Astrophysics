\subsubsection{Predictive Boundaries}

While the standard Schwarzschild and Ledoux criteria for convective (in)stability are well understood, their application to determine the location of convection-zone boundaries entails subtleties that are often overlooked. A specific issue is that elemental abundances at boundaries are often discontinuous, due to the juxtaposition between well-mixed and unmixed regions. The corresponding discontinuities in opacity and o
