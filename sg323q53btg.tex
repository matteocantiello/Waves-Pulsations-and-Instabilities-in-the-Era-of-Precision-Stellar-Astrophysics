\subsection{Dedalus}}

Dedalus is an open-source pseudo-spectral code which can solve nearly arbitrary partial differential equations which the user specifies in plain text. Spectral methods are ideal for simulations of stellar interiors, which are typically studied in periodic boxes for local simulations or spherical geometry for global simulations. It is based in Python and is straightforward to use, with a growing user base. The vast majority of computations
