\subsection{Dedalus}}

Dedalus is an open-source pseudo-spectral code which can solve nearly arbitrary partial differential equations which the user specifies in plain text. Spectral methods are ideal for simulations of stellar interiors, which typically have many spatial symmetries (rotational symmetry for global simulations; translation  symmetry )
