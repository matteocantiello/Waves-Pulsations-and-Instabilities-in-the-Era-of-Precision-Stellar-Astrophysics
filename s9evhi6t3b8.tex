\section{Project Schedule and Management Plan}

We hope to achieve our research goals as follows:

Year 1: Make predictions for locations of instability strips for comparison with GAIA/TESS data, and predict fractions of non-pulsating stars due to magnetic suppression of g modes. Compute initial models of massive stars including parameterized baroclinic AM transport. Upgrade GYRE to include rotational effects. Run Dedalus simulations of convective boundary mixing.

Year 2: Perform Dedalus simulations of baroclinic instabilities to calibrate parameterization. 

We will  hold bi-yearly meetings including each investigator and their students/postdocs working on the proposed research. These meetings will help maintain strong collaboration necessary to efficiently achieve our science goals.
