\section{Project Schedule and Management Plan}

We hope to achieve our research goals as follows:

Year 1: Make predictions for locations of instability strips for comparison with GAIA/TESS data, and predict fractions of non-pulsating stars due to  

We will  hold bi-yearly meetings including each investigator and their students/postdocs working on the proposed research. These meetings will help maintain strong collaboration necessary to efficiently achieve our science goals.
