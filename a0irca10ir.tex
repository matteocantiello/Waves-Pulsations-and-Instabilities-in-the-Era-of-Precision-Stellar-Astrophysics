tesstess ---- lotslots of info about instabilty strips of info about instabilty strips from TESSTESS but not nec. detailed asteroseismology.  what science can we do with instablity strips, especially in more evolved pars of HR disgram  probes of stellar structure and evolution.   need to understand some physics [convection-pulsation] to extract this information.   Tess will observe: 1. Massive main sequence stars 2. More massive red giants/sub giants 3. Subgiant stars 4.  new classes of tidally but not nec. detailed asteroseismology.  what science can we do with instablity strips, especially in more evolved pars of HR disgram  probes of stellar structure and evolution.   need to understand some physics [convection-pulsation] to extract this information.
