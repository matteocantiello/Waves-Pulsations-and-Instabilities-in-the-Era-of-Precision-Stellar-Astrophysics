\subsection{Pulsations observed by Kepler and TESS}



\subsubsection{New asteroseismic observables from TESS}

tess -- lots of info about instabilty strips from TESS but not nec. detailed asteroseismology.  what science can we do with instablity strips, especially in more evolved pars of HR disgram  convection, structure

work on RSGs, etc. here
