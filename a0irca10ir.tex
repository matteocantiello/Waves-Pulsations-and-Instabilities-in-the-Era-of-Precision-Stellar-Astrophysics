\subsection{A New Era of Asteroseismology}

The exquisite photometry produced by the Kepler satellite (including the K2 mission) has revolutionized asteroseismology.   Kep

tess -- lots of info about instabilty strips from TESS but not nec. detailed asteroseismology.  what science can we do with instablity strips, especially in more evolved pars of HR disgram  probes of stellar structure and evolution.   need to understand some physics [convection-pulsation] to extract this information.   Tess will observe: 1. Massive main sequence stars 2. More massive red giants/sub giants 3. Subgiant stars 4.  new classes of tidally excited pulsators, paritcularly more massive stars.   The first two were absent in the Kepler field, while the last will be helped by the shorter TESS cadence.

work some of RSGs, etc. here
