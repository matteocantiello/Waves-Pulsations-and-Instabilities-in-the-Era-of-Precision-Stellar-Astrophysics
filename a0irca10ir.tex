\subsection{A New Era of As}



\subsubsection{New asteroseismic observables from TESS}

tess -- lots of info about instabilty strips from TESS but not nec. detailed asteroseismology.  what science can we do with instablity strips, especially in more evolved pars of HR disgram  probes of stellar structure and evolution.   need to understand some physics [convection-pulsation] to extract this information

work some of RSGs, etc. here

\subsubsection{Convectively excited internal waves from COROT, Kepler and TESS}
