\subsection{Effect of Red Supergiant Pulsations on Supernovae}

Given the importance of RSGs to studies of core-collapse supernovae, stellar populations and star formation, we intend to carry out exploratory calculations of a number of aspects of these unusual pulsators. 
%{\color{green} Such modeling can likely impact both the immediate interpretation of observations in distant galaxies and guide the thinking on the likely state of the RSG at the time of final explosion.} 
\citet{1997AampA...327..224H}  explained the instability  as arising from the traditional $\kappa$-mechanism acting in the hydrogen ionization zone. 


%They also pursued initial non-linear calculations of the instability using a 1D hydrodynamic code, noting
