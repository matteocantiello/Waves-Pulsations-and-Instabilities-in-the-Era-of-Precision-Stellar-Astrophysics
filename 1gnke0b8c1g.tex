\subsection{Effect of Red Supergiant Pulsations on Supernovae}

Given the importance of RSGs to studies of core-collapse supernovae, stellar populations and star formation, we intend to carry outexploratory calculations of a number of aspects of these unusual
pulsators. As their dominant pulsations appear to be the fundamental
radial mode, there is opportunity for progress with 1D stellar models
such as MESA, both for the linear and non-linear aspects. Such
modeling can likely impact both the immediate interpretation of observations in
distant galaxies and guide the thinking on the likely state of the RSG
at the time of final explosion.
