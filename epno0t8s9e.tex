%%MESA employs contemporary
%%numerical approaches and is written with present and future
%%shared-memory, multi-core, and multi-thread architectures in mind.
%%MESA combines the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a
%%wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass
%% to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases leading up to
%% explosions.  It solves the fully coupled structure and composition
%% equations simultaneously.  It uses adaptive mesh refinement and
%% sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory
%% parallelism based on OpenMP.  State-of-the-art modules provide
%% equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and element
%% diffusion, as well as atmosphere boundary conditions, and an
%% innovative algorithm for mass loss and mass accretion.  MESA has

\subsection{GYRE}}
  
\textbf{GYRE} solves the 3D linearized hydrodynamic
equations to calculate the nonradial, nonadiabatic oscillation
spectrum of differentially rotating stars \citep{bard11}. It is based
on a spherical harmonic method in angular directions coupled with a
sixth-order Magnus scheme in the radial direction. Initial tests on
$\gtrsim 100$ processor architectures reveal near-linear parallel
scaling. It is available under open-source license, and is the only public oscillation code capable of
considering the effects of nonadiabaticity and/or differential
rotation.
