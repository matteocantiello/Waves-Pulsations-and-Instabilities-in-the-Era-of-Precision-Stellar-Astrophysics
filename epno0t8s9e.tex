\textbf{MESA}, Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics, solves the 1D fully coupled structure and composition
equations governing stellar evolution . It
is based on an implicit finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh
refinement and sophisticated timestep controls; 
state-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear
reaction rates, and element diffusion.

It is 
available under an open-source license and has  attracted $>800$ 
 users.

\subsection{GYRE}}
 \textbf{GYRE} solves the 3D linearized hydrodynamic
equations to calculate the nonradial, nonadiabatic oscillation
spectrum of differentially rotating stars \citep{bard11}. It is based
on a spherical harmonic method in angular directions coupled with a
sixth-order Magnus scheme in the radial direction. Initial tests on
$\gtrsim 100$ processor architectures reveal near-linear parallel
scaling. It is available under open-source release in
Spring 2013, and will be the only public oscillation code capable of
considering the effects of nonadiabaticity and/or differential
rotation.
