{\color{red} \subsection{White Dwarfs}}
Many WDs show strong surface magnetic fields ($B>$3MG). The fraction of strongly magnetic WDs is debated, but usually is discussed to be of the order of 10\%. Interestingly, magnetized WDs are systematically more massive \cite{Ferrario_2015}, which could be explained if the observed magnetic fields descend from a main sequence convective core dynamo \cite{Cantiello_2016}. This is because the extension of convective cores during the main sequence extends to mass coordinates above 0.6$M_\odot$ only in stars with initial mass $M>3M_\odot$, so that the entire mass of the WD descendant lies within the mass coordinate occupied by the MS convective core.
