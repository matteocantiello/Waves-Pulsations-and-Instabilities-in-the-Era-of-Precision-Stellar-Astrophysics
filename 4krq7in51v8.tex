\subsubsection{Angular Momentum Mixing by Convectively Excited Waves}}

Do we really want a section on this?  I guess this kinda overlaps with Jim's ATP?  I could write something about running multi-dimensional simulations of wave generation by convection to test some of the ideas that we've been using in previous papers.  E.g., stochastic spin-up might not be too hard because it's a relatively short timescale
