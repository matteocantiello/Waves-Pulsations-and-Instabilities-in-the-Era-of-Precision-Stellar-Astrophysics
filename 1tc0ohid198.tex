\subsection{Compact Object Rotation}

The rotation rates of compact objects are determined by the internal physics of their stellar progenitors, and are essential to understanding high energy phenomena such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts. With LIGO's first black hole detections, we now have accurate spin constraints on non-accreting black holes. Combining white dwarf rotation rates from asteroseismology, pulsar rotation rates, we
